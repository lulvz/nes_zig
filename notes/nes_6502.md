# NES Memory Map and Address Decoding

In the NES, the 6502 CPU decodes the first few bits of an address to determine what memory region it is accessing. Depending on the specific hardware, different amounts of the lower bits are decoded to select the specific part of the region. This results in **mirroring**, not because the memory values are duplicated, but because incomplete decoding causes addresses to wrap around to the same part of a memory region.

## NES Memory Regions

| Address Range  | Size    | Device                                        |
|----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Lower 11 bits are decoded** |         |                                               |
| `$0000–$07FF`  | `$0800` | 2 KB internal RAM                             |
| `$0800–$0FFF`  | `$0800` | Mirrors of `$0000–$07FF`                      |
| `$1000–$17FF`  | `$0800` | Mirrors of `$0000–$07FF`                      |
| `$1800–$1FFF`  | `$0800` | Mirrors of `$0000–$07FF`                      |
| **Lower 3 bits are decoded** |         |                                               |
| `$2000–$2007`  | `$0008` | NES PPU registers                             |
| `$2008–$3FFF`  | `$1FF8` | Mirrors of `$2000–$2007` (repeats every 8 bytes) |
| **Lower 5 bits are decoded** |         |                                               |
| `$4000–$4017`  | `$0018` | NES APU and I/O registers                      |
| `$4018–$401F`  | `$0008` | APU and I/O functionality (normally disabled)  |
| **Handled by the cartridge** |         |                                               |
| `$4020–$FFFF`  | `$BFE0` | Unmapped. Available for cartridge use.         |
| • `$6000–$7FFF` | `$2000` | Usually cartridge RAM (if present).            |
| • `$8000–$FFFF` | `$8000` | Usually cartridge ROM and mapper registers.    |
